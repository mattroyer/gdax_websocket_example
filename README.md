# GDAX WebSocket Example

In this project, I'm using Vue.js and the GDAX public WebSocket API

I hope that this can be a project to help anyone to simply subscribe to their API and ride the wave of crypto. Plus, I would really like people to make it their own so that they can make it look pretty and add to the functionality of a fully client-capable cryptocurrency view.
